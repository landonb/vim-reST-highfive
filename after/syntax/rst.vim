" *** SYNTAX GROUP: reST section highlighting.

function! s:DubsClr_rstSections()
  " reST header syntax can use any of the 32 punctation keys found on a US keyboard:
  "
  "   ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
  "
  " The documentation recommends using a subset of those, because "some characters
  " are more suitable than others":
  "
  "   = - ` : . ' " ~ ^ _ * + #
  "
  " Omitted from included rst syntax runtime:
  "
  "   ! $ % & ( ) , / ; < > ? @ [ \ ] { | }
  "
  " Although I'd respond that that's really user preference, and that the syntax
  " plugin should honor what reST itself honors. (I'd concede this might not be
  " the case if certain punctuation is used in a way that's not for headerizing,
  " but that might be interpreted as such, e.g., a merge conflict uses angle
  " brackets in such a way:
  "
  "   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  "   some code
  "   ==============
  "   other code
  "   >>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  "
  " and we wouldn't want any of this to be interpreted as headerization.
  " (But such code would most likely be in a block quote, anyway.)
  "
  " I'm adding in the missing punctuation and we'll see how it goes.
  "
  " (What I really want is a few more 'Big' symbols that'll look good
  " as the main, top-level section. I currently use '#', which is the
  " character that uses the most ink of all available characters. But
  " I think '$', '@', and '&' could also work to convey main-sectionness.)

function! s:Presto_HRrules()
  " 2018-01-30: NUTS!
  "
  "   This is pretty cool. And it only serves one purpose:
  "     Making me color-happy when reSTing.
  "   That is, if I repeat the same character 8 or more times
  "     on its own line, it'll be highlighted!
  "   You can fiddle with the highlights for specific characters
  "     below.
  "   In this way, you can create more visually appealing reST
  "     documents, and you can more easily highlight section
  "     headers, as well as section delimiters!

  " - The HR match interferes with rstSections, whether it's defined before or
  "   after, and I'm not sure what's up, so only highlight when HR is followed
  "   by newlines, to avoid conflict.
  "   - (And note that `\n\n` sorta works, but the highlight only works if
  "      there are two trailing blank lines; whereas using just `\n` works,
  "      but then the top line of a real section header gets hijack-highlighted
  "      (the top line of the header should be rstSections like the header
  "      title and the bottom line of the header, but instead the top line
  "      gets a rstFakeHRAll match).
  "
  " - Note that the captured (.) character \1 matches case-insensitively.
  "   - E.g., `e` will match `E`, so
  "       EEeeeeEEEEEEeee
  "     will match.
  "   - There's probably a way to match case-sensitively but meh.

" 2021-01-16: This syntax plugin had been opt-in per file: you'd have
